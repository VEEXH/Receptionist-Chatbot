# Receptionist Chatbot
This Python program simulates a chatbot that can assist a receptionist in answering common questions and directing visitors to the appropriate department.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Usage
To run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is located. Then enter the following command:

## Copy code
python chatbot.py
The chatbot will greet the user and prompt for a question. The user can ask any question they like, and the chatbot will try to find a matching answer from its pre-defined list of common questions and answers. If the chatbot cannot find a matching answer, it will print a message indicating that it cannot help with the question. To exit the chatbot, the user can enter "exit".

## Customization
The chatbot's list of common questions and answers, as well as its greetings and farewells, can be customized by modifying the corresponding lists in the code. Simply add or remove items from the lists as desired.
